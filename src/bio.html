            Hi, I'm Alicia. I am an aspiring full stack developer based in
            Melbourne, Australia. I aspire to be a software developer because I
            am attracted to the innovation, flexibility and the limitless
            potential it offers. I believe a career in tech can satiate my
            passion for growth and lifelong learning, and that my interpersonal
            and critical thinking skills will be an asset to my future teams in
            the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to write programmes that will benefit businesses and the
            community, to play a part in improving the diversity within the
            field and to build a career that inspires me for decades to come.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up in New Zealand and completed my schooling years there
            before moving to Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Professionally, I have practised optometry in metro and regional
            settings across Australia. My research during my honours year at
            university has been published in two papers. I have built rapport
            with patients of all backgrounds, worked under pressure in fast
            paced settings, supported my teammates and learnt from mistakes.
            Most recently, I completed a programme to become an optometry
            business partner at my previous company.
          </p>
          <p>
            A believer in giving back to the community, I have volunteered at
            organisations across New Zealand, Australia and Brazil. This ranged
            from sight screening at the Special Olympics in Wellington to
            working with children in a low socioeconomic community in SÃ£o Paolo.

          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            I have always had a growth mindset and been naturally curious.
            Throughout my schooling years, I have been active about pushing
            myself out of my comfort zone and applying myself to new experiences
            and extracurricular activities in music, sports, arts and leadership
            positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to explore new places and see breath-taking sights. I tend to
            plan travel around food but find the most rewarding experiences come
            from the connections I form with new friends along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like to tell people I moved to Melbourne for its vibrant food
            scene and delicious pastries. I enjoy trying out new restaurants and
            cuisines, love a good oat milk latte, and dabble in pottery. I try
            to spend any spare moment with my cheeky Shiba Inu puppy, Eddy-Mame.
